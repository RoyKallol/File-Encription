But other algorithms don’t give 4 solutions.
This can only find one solution.
For thus reason we choose the algorithm.
On the other hand the accuracy is as much as Newton-Raphson algorithm.
From the above, we see that our implemented algorithm is much slow than other algorithm.
This take more numbers of iteration than the other 4 algorithm.
